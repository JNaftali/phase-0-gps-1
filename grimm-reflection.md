Before we started I was a little bit unclear on cloning and the proper workflow for GitHub with my confusion being around feature branch and master branch proper merging methodology.

GPS 1.1 helped correct my understanding that you never update the master branch from your local bash. Always update through a pull request in order to move to the merge step. I now think of the term "pull request" as a way to "pull everything together".

I asked questions about how to understand the origin / remote commands with GitHub and how they are both linked through web address. 

I feel that I have a strong understanding of Git and I was able to provide clarification to my partner on 2.4 coding assignment because he was merging the feature branch on master branch locally and was able to show him the correct way.

It was a great experience. Partner and I went pretty smoothly through the GPS session and both of us were effective drivers and navigators.
