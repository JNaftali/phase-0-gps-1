#Reflection on GPS 1.1

* I mostly had a good handle on git before the session, but was a little fuzzy on the details of git pull/fetch and clone/commit.
* I better learned how to initialize and sync remote and local copies of a repository.
* I asked how to check what the differences between a branch of a local repository and it's remote.
* I feel fairly confident that I understand how the commands I have learned work, but I know that git is a powerful tool and can do more than I've learned to do as of yet.
* Pairing was good. My pair and I both approached the session looking to learn and we worked together to figure out how to solve the problem set before us. All in all, definitely a positive experience.
